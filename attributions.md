# This is the document for all the Creative Commons Attributions. 
Changes were probably made by running the Creative Commons work through Tokentool to create .webp icons and add a border. This document is a reasonable attempt to attribute appropriately, but this is not to suggest that the licensor endorses this project or the use of the artwork.

This file documents any use of attributions for this module. It also uses the same conventions as the Essential Companion.
